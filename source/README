I suggest you use the Docker image diegonehab/vg. If, for some reason, you
decide not to...

On Windows, do not use the makefile.
First, download all precompiled libraries from the course page (vc19.zip).
Expand the vc19.zip to some directory.
(Warning, icu is a gigantic lib. This will unpack to 1GB of data.)
Modify paths.props to reflect where you expanded vc19.zip.
Then, open the solution file (vg.sln) provided with Visual Studio 2019.
When running, I suggest you use git-bash.
When input and output is to console, prefix calls to Lua with with winpty.

For Linux and Mac OS, please read the makefile for further instructions.
