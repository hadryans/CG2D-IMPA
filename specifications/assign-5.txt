Fifth assignment: Accelerated rendering
-----------------------------------

1) About the assignment

In this assignment, you will implement one of the two
acceleration datastructures we discussed in class: The
shortcut tree, or the shortcut regular grid.  You will also
present your work to the rest of the class.  Run-time
performance and correctness will both be considered when
grading your assignment.

Please remember that visual debugging is fundamental when
implementing complicated geometric algorithms. Spend some
time making sure the command line options "-tx", "-ty",
"-p", and "-pattern" do what they should do:

    -tx:<x> and -ty:<y> translate the scene in screen coordinates
    -pattern:<n>        loads and uses the blue noise supersampling pattern
                        with <n> samples
    -p:<n>              keeps only the nth painted shape in the scene

We will test your code using antialiasing, so make sure to
do the same!

2) Handing in your assignment

Create a directory with "<first-name>-<last-name>" where
<first-name> is your first name, and <last-name> is your
last name. Place your file "render.lua" as well as all your
new RVG test files inside this directory. Create a zip
archive "<first-name>-<last-name>.zip" with the contents.
Send the file to your TA as an attachment to an e-mail with
the subject "[2dcg] Assignment 5".

Good luck!
