Second assignment: Drawing paths painted with opaque solid colors.
-----------------------------------

Now that you are familiar with BÃ©zier curves and with our
representation of paths, we can move on to more
sophisticated shapes.

Start by getting paths with linear segments to work

    pathtriangle1.rvg
    pathtriangle2.rvg
    pathtriangle3.rvg
    pathtriangle4.rvg
    pathpolygon.rvg
    patheopolygon.rvg
    pathlion.rvg
    quad2.rvg

Then move on to paths that contain quadratic segments as
well

    quad3.rvg
    parabola1.rvg
    parabola2.rvg
    parabola3.rvg
    parabola4.rvg
    parabola5.rvg
    parabola6.rvg
    hello-ttf.rvg

Then work on cubics

    quad4.rvg
    cubic1.rvg
    cubic2.rvg
    cubic3.rvg
    cubic4.rvg
    cubic5.rvg
    cubic6.rvg
    cubic7.rvg
    cubic8.rvg
    cubic9.rvg
    ampersand.rvg
    hello_type1.rvg

Finally work on rational quadratics

    arc1.rvg
    arc2.rvg
    arc3.rvg
    arc4.rvg
    arc5.rvg

As soon as you are done, these larger files should also work

    puss-in-boots.rvg
    pirate-with-knife.rvg
    reschart.rvg
    page.rvg

These should take a *significant* amount of time to render.
We will work on speeding up their computation in later
assignments.

Many of the remaining input files contain transparency or
color gradients. We will learn about them in the following
classes. Please don't worry about them for now.

3) Handing in your assignment

Create a directory with "<first-name>-<last-name>" where
<first-name> is your first name, and <last-name> is your
last name. Create a zip file "<first-name>-<last-name>.zip"
with the contents.  Send the zip file to the TA as an attachment
to an e-mail with the subject "[2dcg] Assignment 2".

Good luck!
